Logistic Regression Model built on Titanic passengers dataset.

Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

Project Overview
This project builds a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using Python.

Problem Statement
Given passenger details such as age, gender, class, and fare, predict whether the passenger survived.

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Size: ~900 rows

Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

Results
- Model Accuracy: 80%
- Key Insight: Female passengers and higher-class passengers had higher survival rates.
